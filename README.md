# Pokemon_Card_Collection
So I can show my current collection to my friends and potentional buyers. Plus this helped me work with a working search bar and how to search for different names of a card using "data-tags" so that was cool. Search bar doesn't dim how I want to when scrolling but it also doesn't look bad to me so I am cool with it.
